#Simple Angular2 Webpack starter

Setting it up with gulp was too complicated, especially when jspm/Systemjs is still young and not mature enough.
There is just simply not enough documentation and blog posts about it at this time.

#How to build

```
npm install
npm start
```

To see the output, use
```
npm run build.dev
```

You will see `dist` folder created on the project root.

I have not built production ready build yet.
